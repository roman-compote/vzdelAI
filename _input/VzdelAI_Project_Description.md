## 4. Current Situation and Problem Statement

### 4.1 Challenges in 21st Century Education

- Traditional pedagogical methods based on homogeneous approaches are losing effectiveness
- Growing need for personalized and adaptive education reflecting individual abilities, preferences, and learning pace
- **High administrative and pedagogical burden on teachers** who must provide effective knowledge transfer while individually approaching students with varying knowledge levels and learning styles
- Teachers face: lack of time for individualized materials, need for frequent assessment, absence of analytical tools
- **Students** have access to wide spectrum of online resources but lack systematic guidance and adequate performance feedback
- Absence of personalized approach leads to demotivation, ineffective learning, and deepening educational gaps

### 4.2 Limitations of Existing AI Solutions in Education

- Fragmented, lacking interoperability with existing educational systems
- Often fail to meet national curricular framework requirements
- Focus primarily on knowledge testing rather than the learning process itself
- Insufficient personalized feedback and adaptive support
- **No comparable system exists in Slovakia** implementing AI at this level for personalized learning and teacher support

### 4.3 Comparative Advantages

- **Academic-industry synergy:** University researchers + IT companies ensure high quality outputs and practical implementation
- **Scalability:** Modular AI infrastructure expandable across educational levels (primary through university) → [[REQ-NFR-04-scalability-security|REQ-NFR-04]]
- **Adaptability to Slovak educational system:** Unlike foreign generalized AI solutions, VzdelAI reflects curricular requirements and local educational specifics
