# Requirements Index

> [!note]
> This index provides a dynamic overview of all system requirements extracted from the [[VzdelAI_Project_Description]]. Tables are generated by Dataview and update automatically as requirement documents are added or modified.

## Summary Statistics

- **Total requirements:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p["req-id"]).length`
- **Must-have:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p.priority == "must").length`
- **Should-have:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p.priority == "should").length`
- **Could-have:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p.priority == "could").length`

### By Source Type

> [!info] Source type convention
> Each requirement has a `source-type` field indicating its origin:
> - **extracted** — directly traceable to a specific section in the [[VzdelAI_Project_Description]]
> - **derived** — inferred from the project description or from dependencies between extracted requirements
> - **stakeholder** — emerged from team discussions, research, or design decisions with no direct source in the input document
>
> For details see [[requirements-review-2026-02-18#Proposed Strategy]].

- **Extracted:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p["source-type"] == "extracted").length`
- **Derived:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p["source-type"] == "derived").length`
- **Stakeholder:** `$= dv.pages('"requirements" AND -"requirements/_requirement-template"').where(p => p.tags && dv.isArray(p.tags) && p.tags.includes("type/requirement") && p["source-type"] == "stakeholder").length`

## Design Decision: Deliverables Excluded

> [!warning] Scope boundary
> Project deliverables (§2: publications, theses, conference, courses, TRL targets) are **not** modeled as system requirements — they are project outputs, not system behaviors. They can be tracked separately in a `deliverables/` folder if needed later. System-relevant deliverables (TRL 4/5 targets) are captured via acceptance criteria within the technical requirements.
