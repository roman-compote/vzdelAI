# VzdelAI — AI-Powered Digital Assistant for Education

> **University of Žilina, Faculty of Operation and Economics of Transport and Communications (PEDaS)**

VzdelAI is a research project aimed at developing an intelligent digital assistant that provides **personalized support to both teachers and students** using modern AI technologies. The platform leverages large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and adaptive learning techniques to enhance the educational experience at the university level.

## Project Goals

- Develop AI models adapted specifically for educational use cases
- Build an interactive platform (VzdelAI) integrating with existing university tools (MS Teams, Moodle)
- Generate personalized study materials for students
- Analyze the impact of AI-assisted learning on educational outcomes
- Create new AI-enhanced courses in Economics and Finance domains
- Publish research findings and methodologies
